once upon a time
in a strange land far far away
there lived afriendly giant

the big bad bear arrived
he ate all the porridge
the bear fell asleep but he wasnt really asleep, he was only pretending. 
goldielocks found the bear asleep
who knows what happened next
the bear ate goldilocks as well as the porridge
the bear lived happily ever after
